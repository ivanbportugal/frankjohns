                <p>Our loss prevention philosophy is basic: a store-centric loss prevention program builds a business culture of reducing shrink.  Our program’s strategy focuses on delivering quality service to all business partners within your brand including store operations, merchandising, supply chain, human resources, finance, etc.  This strategy replaces the traditional focus of loss prevention, which is solely to lower shrink through apprehension methods.</p>

<p>Our consulting services can show you how to transform your team into a well-rounded business partner that understands more than apprehending shoplifters and/or investigating internal theft cases. The loss prevention department must be a fully integrated business partner with regards to auditing company procedures, finding alternative methods to locking up merchandise, and training associates on audit findings to gain improvement (rather than just checking the box and checking out).</p>

<p>The loss prevention team must work with merchandising to understand the latest products and how they will be marketed. The team needs to be the leader in determining shrink issues from the accounting process to the inventory process. Finally, the loss prevention team should be an integral partner in determining strategies to reduce shrink and expenses to make your brand more profitable. Only after implementing these strategies will your loss prevention team truly be a welcome business partner to your executive team. We will show you how.</p>
